# Lunch Buddy Privacy Summary

Version: 2025-10-16
Contact: mailto:lunch-buddy@adamstiskala.com
Policy: /privacy-policy.html

Data We Access:
- API key you supply so the app can call the Lunch Money API on your behalf.
- Budget, category, transaction, and recurring expense information returned directly from Lunch Money when you use the app.
- Category preferences and notification settings you adjust inside the app.

Storage & Processing:
- API keys and display preferences are stored locally in your browser via `localStorage`.
- The optional background notification feature stores the API key, alert signature, and warning threshold in the service worker's IndexedDB to evaluate budgets while the app is closed.
- Offline support comes from the service worker, which caches static assets and the most recent API responses on your device.

Third Parties:
- Network requests go only to the Lunch Money API base (`https://dev.lunchmoney.app/v1`).
- Our third party hosts (Netlify and CloudFlare) may create standard access logs containing IP address, user agent, and timestamps.

User Control:
- Use the sign-out option or clear browser storage to remove the stored API key and cached data.
- Disable notifications from within the category preferences dialog or through your browserâ€™s notification permissions.
